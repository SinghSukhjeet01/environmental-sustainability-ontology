🌱 Environmental Sustainability Ontology

A Semantic Web and Knowledge Engineering project modeling the complex relationship between human activities and environmental sustainability using OWL and RDF-based technologies.
📘 Introduction

Humanity’s relentless exploitation of natural resources, unchecked industrial activity, and rapid urbanization have led to global environmental degradation. This manifests as climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and resource depletion — all of which pose significant risks to ecosystems, public health, and planetary well-being.

This project aims to examine the interplay between human activities and the environment at local, regional, and global scales. We explore sustainability-related practices across multiple sectors, including:

    🌾 Agriculture

    🏭 Manufacturing

    ⚡ Energy production

    🚛 Transportation

    ♻️ Waste management

We also consider the role of policies, government structures, and social behavior in shaping environmental outcomes.
🎯 Project Scope

This ontology focuses on capturing key concepts and relationships within the domain of environmental sustainability. It is designed to:

    Represent sustainability efforts across industries

    Model how different policies influence environmental practices

    Support analysis and decision-making for stakeholders

    Enable semantic querying of sustainability knowledge

The ultimate goal is to support informed, evidence-based transitions toward more sustainable systems.
🔄 Ontology Reuse

This ontology is built entirely from scratch. No existing ontologies have been reused, imported, or extended. All classes, properties, and individuals are custom-developed to suit the specific needs of this project.
❓ Competency Questions

The ontology is designed to answer the following key questions:

    What are the objectives, effectiveness rating, and targeted grade levels for any given EducationPolicy?

    What types of government are represented, and what social policies are implemented by each type?

    Which innovation hubs have an innovation index greater than 80? Provide their names.

    Which learning organizations emphasize a culture of continuous learning?

    What entities are promoting cultural diversity, and how many languages are they associated with?

    Which learning organizations have a technology adoption rate over 80? Provide their names and adoption rates.

    Which government entities demonstrate a high level of operational transparency?

These questions ensure that the ontology supports practical use cases, reasoning, and semantic querying using technologies such as SPARQL.
